# Project Euler Solutions

This is a collection of my solutions to problems on
[Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net). My solutions are written in an
amazing little language called Haskell.

Remember that the fun in programming challenges is solving them yourself, so
please keep that in mind before viewing these files!
